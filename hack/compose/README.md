# Compose

With the `docker-compose` snippets within this directory you are able to plug
different setups of Gopad together. Below you can find some example
combinations.

## Base

First of all we need the base definition and we need to decide if we want to
build the Docker image dynamically or if we just want to use a released Docker
image.

### Build

This simply takes the currently cloned source and builds a new Docker image
including all local changes.

```console
docker-compose -f hack/compose/base.yml -f hack/compose/build.yml up
```

### Image

This simply downloads the defined Docker image from Docker Hub and
starts/configures it properly.

```console
docker-compose -f hack/compose/base.yml -f hack/compose/image.yml up
```

## Database

After deciding the base of it you should choose one of the supported databases.
Here we got currently the following options so far.

### SQLite

This simply configures a named volume for the SQLite storage used as a database
backend.

```console
docker-compose <base from above> -f hack/compose/db/sqlite.yml up
```

### MariaDB

This simply starts an additional container for a MariaDB instance used as a
database backend.

```console
docker-compose <base from above> -f hack/compose/db/mariadb.yml up
```

### PostgreSQL

This simply starts an additional container for a PostgreSQL instance used as a
database backend.

```console
docker-compose <base from above> -f hack/compose/db/postgres.yml up
```

## Upload

Finally you should also decide how to handle file uploads within the API server.
Here we got currently the following options so far.

### File

This simply configures a named volume to store uploads just on a filesystem
without any additional service.

```console
docker-compose <db from above> -f hack/compose/upload/file.yml up
```

### Minio

This simply starts an additional container for a Minio instance to store uploads
in a S3 compatible storage.

```console
docker-compose <db from above> -f hack/compose/upload/minio.yml up
```
